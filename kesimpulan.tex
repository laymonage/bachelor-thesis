\section{Conclusions}
%---------------------------------------------------------------

The primary objective of this research is to implement a new \verb|JSONField|
that can be used on all database backends supported by Django. The
\verb|JSONField| implementation includes the model field, form field, lookups,
and transforms. The implementation should handle the differences in how JSON
data is managed by all of the database systems, which consist of PostgreSQL,
MariaDB, MySQL, SQLite, and Oracle Database.

To handle the differences between the database systems, some adjustments to the
database backends were needed. The adjustments include the additions of new
feature flags in the \verb|DatabaseFeature| classes of the database backends.
The flags indicate the different behaviors of each database system, which can
be used to determine how the implementation on the database system should be
created. Some adjustments were also made to the \verb|DatabaseWrapper| classes
to define the data types and SQL \verb|CHECK| constraints on the database
level. Some database backends also require some adjustments to the
\verb|DatabaseOperations| class to define some casting operations for JSON
data.

After creating the database backend adjustments, \verb|JSONField| and its
lookups and transforms could be implemented. The \verb|JSONField| model field
was implemented by serializing the data before it is sent to the database and
deserializing the data when it is retrieved from the database. On the other
hand, the \verb|JSONField| form field could be used without any modifications
as it does not interact with the database directly. Both the model field and
form fields were updated to support custom encoder and decoder for
serialization and deserialization. The lookups and transforms were implemented
by utilizing the JSON functions that are available on the database systems.

The secondary objective of this research is to provide examples of how
validation rules can be applied to a \verb|JSONField|. For demonstration, a
small Django project with an e-commerce scenario was created. The project
includes two models, \verb|Product| and \verb|Cart|, that represent a product
and a shopping cart on an e-commerce website. The \verb|Cart| model has a
\verb|JSONField| that uses validators to validate the data. The validators were
added using the Django's validation feature. By utilizing the validators, JSON
data in a model field could be validated by calling the \verb|clean_fields()|
method of the model instance and catching the \verb|ValidationError| exception.

To ensure that the new implementation of \verb|JSONField| is consistent on all
database backends, \verb|JSONField| tests were run on all database systems. The
tests included test cases for the new features and documented behaviors, such
as the custom decoder support and the \verb|JSONField| behavior when handling
JSON \verb|null| and SQL \verb|NULL| values. In addition, the \verb|JSONField|
tests also incorporated the tests from the previous PostgreSQL-only
implementation to ensure that backward compatibility is preserved. After
passing the tests, the previous implementation was deprecated by creating
replicas of the classes and raising system warnings about the deprecation.

\section{Suggestions}
%---------------------------------------------------------------
Based on the results of this research, some suggestions for future research are
as follow:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The Query Expression API in Django supports a variety of use cases
		  through the use of built-in and custom query expressions. While the
		  tests in this research have included the common use cases, it is not
		  feasible to test each and every possible use case with
		  \verb|JSONField|. Thus, more complex use cases of \verb|JSONField|
		  and Django's ORM tool on all database backends may be a subject of
		  future research.
	\item Some database systems support partial updates to JSON data through
		  the use of database functions for more efficient write operations on
		  JSON columns. The implementation in this research does not make use
		  of the partial update feature, which means that JSON data is always
		  updated by rewriting the whole data. Future research on
		  \verb|JSONField| can improve upon this research by utilizing the
		  partial update feature on database systems that support it.
	\item This research has provided some examples of JSON data validation,
		  including a basic example of how the schema of a \verb|JSONField| can
		  be validated. For more complex schemas, third-party packages can be
		  utilized to create the validation rules. Integrating the third-party
		  packages with Django's validators may be explored in future
		  research.
\end{enumerate}
